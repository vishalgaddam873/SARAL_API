It requires your **extraordinary commitment**, **passion** & **hard work**. The program relies on **peer learning**, and expects you to be **available all throughout the year** to maximising your learning and ensure that every student learns well. \\n\\nNavGurukul isn\u2019t a conventional school or college, instead is like a family or a home. Students are expected to stay here, learn, celebrate their joys and festivals, share their sorrows and help each other in their journeys. \\n\\nThere are no official leaves including that of festivals like Diwali, Eid or Christmas. Hpwever there are a few exceptions as follows:\\n* Upto **12 days leaves** in case of death of an immediate family member - father, mother and siblings\\n* Upto **4 days leaves** in case of death of close family members - grandparents, uncles, aunts\\n* Upto **20 days leaves** (once in the entire year) for university/college exams\\n\\nYet, if the student needs to take leaves for any other purpose - health (personal or family), important event or ceremony which can\u2019t be avoided, etc. student needs to inform about his leave to the Center Incharge **at least 3 days in advance**. The student has to spend **two days in community serving** for each leave that he or she takes. The rationale of this policy is the realisation, that **any leave by the student hurts the interest of the entire group**. Hence, by engaging in community serving student can think responsibly and also add value to the community.\\n\",\"submissionType\":null,\"githubLink\":\"https://github.com/navgurukul/newton/tree/master/getting-started/leaves.md\"}"
